## The Alphabet

The best place to start with learning any language is the alphabet. With 14 vowels and 30 consonants
the Hungarian Alphabet is a total of 44 letters. Hungarian is a phonetic language so once you master the alphabet, you'll be able to speak
every word that you can read first time every time!

```
A Á B C Cs D Dz Dzs E É F
a á b c cs d dz dzs e é f

G Gy H I Í J K L Ly M N
g gy h i í j k l ly m n

Ny O Ó Ö Ő P Q R S Sz T 
ny o ó ö ő p q r s sz t  

Ty U Ú Ü Ű V W X Y Z Zs
ty u ú ü ű v w x y z zs
```

It should be noted that the Hungarian Language has **gemination**, or consonant lengthening.
Consonants can be paired together for a longer consonant sound. Every word in Hungarian is stressed on the first syllable.

* Legsze**bb** - Most beautiful
* U**jj** - <span class="spoiler">Finger</span>
* Á**ll**  - He/She stands
* Kö**nny** - Tear (Long ny)
* Sebe**ss**ég - Speed
* A**ssz**ony - Mrs. (Long sz)

See how only the first letter of a diagraph (double-letter) is lengthened.

When some consonants are combined, the pronunciation changes slightly. Try to recognise the base words to see which consonants really are there.

* Igazság (Igaz - true) becomes [Iga*ss*ág]
* Állj meg! (Áll) becomes [Á*jj* meg!]
* Egészség (Egész - whole) becomes [Egé*ss*ég] 
* Ne haragudj! (Haragszik - he/she is angry) becomes [Ne haragu*ggy*!]

## Vowel Harmony

Grammarwise, Hungarian solves all their problems with prefixes and suffixes, the way these attachments sound depends on vowel harmony. 

The vowels in Hungarian are paired. The second row marks elongation on the vowels (and a change in sound for á and é).
```
a e i o ö u ü
á é í ó ő ú ű
```

For vowel harmony, these vowels are sorted as either front of back. Here are some non-sensical sentences to remember each.

```
Front: e é i í ö ő ü ű (Öt üveg-űző épít itt.)
Back:  a á o ó u ú     (A Zuzmó-Háború.)
```

* If a word contains only front-vowels, then it should be conjugated with front-vowels. (épület)
* Likewise, if a word contains only back-vowels, then it should be conjugated with back vowels. (darázs)
* If a word contains a mixture of front and back, the last vowel will specify what kind it is. (dzsungel)

However, if the word is only one-syllable *and* contains only *i* or *í* then it is considered a back-vowel word. (híd)

That's it for now, but stay tuned for later sections where vowel harmony will be discussed again.
