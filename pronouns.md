## Interrogative pronouns

You can use these types of pronouns to ask for information. Here are a few:

* `Mi?,Micsoda? Mik?` >> What?
* `Ki? Kik?` >> Who?
* `Kinek?` >> Whose?
* `Melyik? Melyek?` >> Which?
* `Hol?` >> Where?
* `Mikor?` >> When?
* `Hogyan? Hogy?` >> How?
* `Milyen?` >> What kind of? What like?
* `Mennyi?` >> How much?

The `-k` added on serves as the plural (note the change in `melyik`).

The accusative can be added onto some of these pronouns when asking for *the direct object*.

* `Mit?, Micsodát?` >> What?
* `Kit?` >> Who?

Examples:

* Mik ezek? - (What are these?)
* Hogy vagy? - (How are you?)
* Melyik emeleten vagy? - (Which floor are you on?)

*Alex: Holnap van egy vizsgám* - (I have an exam tomorrow)

*Barnabás: Milyen vizsga?* - (What kind of exam?)

*Alex: Matek, remélem, hogy jó lesz!* - (Maths, I hope it will be good!)

See that `-m` and `-en`? The former marks first person possession while the latter states being *on* something, both of these will be explained later.

## Relative pronouns (incomplete)

These question starters can be used as relative pronouns. Relative pronouns refer to something else and are made by adding `a-`.

* `Ami, amik` >> that, which
* `Aki, akik` >> who
* `Akinek` >> whose
* `Amelyik,amelyek` >> which
* `Ahol` >> where
* `Amikor` >> when
* `Ahogyan, ahogy` >> as
* `Amilyen` >> such as
* `Amennyi` >> as much as

Likewise, as we have added the plural, we can do the same with the accusative.

* `amit, amiket` >> what
* `akit, akiket` >> who

Examples:

* Ez az a hely ahol csak a fantázia szab határt.
* Amelyik kutya ugat, az nem harap - (Idiom: The dog that barks doesn't bite.)
* Vacsoráztam, amikor hívtál. - (I was having dinner (lit. was dinnering) when you called.)
