## The Comparative and Superlative

In English, if you want to show that something is different to something else in some way, you use comparatives.

* It is slower.
* This is more comfortable to wear.
* My brother is taller than me.

And if you want to say that something is the best, no questions asked, then you use the superlative.

* We're here because you're looking for the best of the best of the best, sir!
* He is the fastest man in the world.
* That is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!

Naturally, Hungarian solves this issue with attachments.

To use the comparative, attach `-bb` to the end of a noun, and to make that comparative into a superlative attach `leg-` to the start of that noun. To go *even further beyond* we can attach `leges-` to exaggerate the superlative.

* Te vagy a legnagyobb hős a világon! - (You are the biggest hero in the world!)
* A szomszéd fűje mindig zöldebb. - (This is an expression: The neighbour's grass is always greener.)
* Ő a legeslegszebb lány számomra. - (She's the most beautiful girl for me.)

*Note: számára is a postposition, in this case számomra is more intentional than nekem.*

**BEWARE:** Some nouns will have their vowels shortened when attached. Here are some examples:

* szép - szebb
* jó - jobb
* kevés - kevesebb

## így/úgy

Both `így` and `úgy` are adverbial pronouns, i.e. both roughly translate into this way, or that way. Typically, `úgy` is followed up with more information in the sentence. 

* Úgy többet tanulok, ha elmagyarázod nekem. - (I learn more (this way), if you explain it to me.)
* Így jobb.
*

## ilyen/olyan

## Mint

The word `mint` is used in linkage between nouns, when it is used with the comparative, it translates to than.

* Gyorsabb vagyok, mint egy golyó! - (I'm faster than a bullet!)
*
*

When `mint`is used with `olyan` or `úgy`, it translates to as.

* Ő olyan magas, mint én.
* 
*

*insert challenge, **mint te, olyan leszek!**
