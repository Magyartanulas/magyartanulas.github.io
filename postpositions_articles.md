title: Introduction to Postpositions & Articles

## Articles
---

An article specifies if a noun is a definite thing or an indefinite thing.

In English this is demonstrated by *a/an* or *the*. Article *a* is used when the following noun begins with a consonant (a flower),
and *an* is used when that noun begins with a vowel (an icecream).

* **The** flower - *there is **definitely** only one flower being talked about.*
* **A** flower - *we are talking about one of many flowers out there, it is **not definite**.*

In Hungarian the articles are `egy, a/az`. Article `egy` is indefinite (it is also the number one as well), whereas `a/az` is definite.
Similar to English, `a` is used when the noun begins with a consonant and `az` with a noun beginning with a vowel.

* A kutya - *The dog*
* Az autó - *The car*
* Egy virág - *A flower*

## Spatial Postpositions
---

In English, there are prepositions. They dictate relationships between nouns. Here are some examples of spatial relationships.

* The bird flies *above* the city.
* The man is *below* the bridge.
* The boy is *infront of* the building.

In Hungarian, there are postpositions. They are placed after the noun relationship instead of between. Here are the translations.

* A madár a város felett repül.
* A férfi a híd alatt van.
* A fiú az épület előtt van.

*A kutya a lány mellett ül.*

<span class="spoiler">The dog sits next to the girl.</span>

These postpositions don't indicate relative movement between the nouns, i.e. at that *specifc* point of time, they are not moving away from each other. Spatial postpositions can also represent the relationship of a noun moving towards the other noun or away from that noun.

| Postposition  | Moving towards (to) | No relative movement | Moving away (from) |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Next to       | Mellé               | Mellett              | Mellől             |
| Above         | Fölé                | Felett/Fölött        | Fölül              |
| Below         | Alá                 | Alatt                | Alól               |
| Infront of    | Elé                 | Előtt                | Elől               |
| Behind        | Mögé                | Mögött               | Mögül              |
| Between/Among | Közé                | Között               | Közül              |

Felett and fölött were a result of dialectual differences, however now they are virtually interchangeable.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Postpositions cannot be used with standalone pronouns, you have to attach the personal pronoun suffix instead.

* István sat next to me.
  * ~~István én mellé ült.~~
  * István mellé**m** ült. (Sitting implies moving to sit somewhere, thus mellém is used instead of melletem)
  
* The man came out from behind you
  * ~~A férfi te mögül kijött~~
  * A férfi kijött mögül**ed**.
