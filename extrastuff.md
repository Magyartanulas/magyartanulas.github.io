## Creating Adverbs
---

Here are two common adverb-making suffixes.

### Essive-Modal (-l/ul/-ül)

Front-voweled words take `-ül`, back-voweled words take `-ul` and words ending in vowels take `-l`

***Essively***, meaning that a noun is given a role to fulfill, *as something*. This is done to nouns.

* Például - (As an example) From `példa`
* Ajándékul - (As a gift) From `ajándék`

***Modally***, describes the manner of the person/people doing the verb. This is done to adjectives.

* Jól - (Well) From `jó`
* Rosszul - (Badly) From `rossz`
* Makacsul - (Stubbornly) From `makacs`
* Remekül - (Superbly) From `remek`
* Egyedül - (Alone)

It is also used to show the language someone speaks.

* Magyarul - (lit. Hungarianly) From `magyar`
* Angolul - (lit. Englishly) From `angol`
* Németül - (lit. Germanly) From `német`
* Finnül - (lit. Finnishly) From `finn`

### Adverbial (-n/-an/-en/-on)

Front-voweled words take `-en`, back-voweled words take `-an,-on` and words ending in vowels take `-n`. This is done to adjectives.

* Gyorsan - (Quickly) From `gyors`
* Gyakran - (Frequently) From `gyakor`
* Csendesen - (Silently) From `csend`
* Szépen - (Beautifully/Nicely) From `szép`
* Nagyon - (Very) From `nagy`
* Gazdagon - (Richly) From `gazdag`
* Ritkán - (Rarely) From `ritka`

Look out for irregularites!

* Lassan - (Slowly) From `lassú`

## Creating Nouns
---

There are two ways of creating nouns, the former deals with adjectives/nouns/verbs becoming nouns and the latter with only verbs becoming nouns.

### "-ness"(-ság/-ség)

Front-voweled words take `-ség`, back-voweled words take `-ság`. Crudely speaking, this can be thought of as a "-ness" ending, but it also turns nouns and verbs into nouns.

* Sötétség - (Darkness) From `sötét`
* Segítség - (Help) From `segít`
* Rendőrség - (Police) From `rendőr`
* Igazság - (Truth) From `igaz`
* Szabadság - (Freedom) From `szabad`
* Barátság - (Friendship) From `barát`

### Verb to Noun (-ás/-és)

Front-voweled words take `-ás`, back-voweled words take `-és`.

* Utazás - (Journey) From `utaz`

### This/That

In English, we use the pronoun/definite article "this" when we are talking about something near to us, in either space or time, and "that" when it is further away. Hungarian uses `ez` and `az` similarly. Take note that the one used in each specific situation can vary slightly from English; familiarity will come with practice.

ez - this  
az - that

Just like English, these can be used in different ways. Firstly, its use as a definite article, to specify proximity of a noun to the speaker: 

* ez a kutyá - (this dog)
* ez az alma - (this apple)
* az a fá - (that tree)
* az az óra - (that clock)

There are two things to be noted from these examples.
1. Unlike in Engish, the definite article `a/az` must also be used.
2. In the previous section, we explained how when the next word starts with a vowel sound, the definite article `a` becomes `az`. Therefore, `az` can have two meanings, and a phrase such as `az az óra` (that clock) is possible. The first `az` means "that" and the second means "the."
