Here is some stuff that may go into the website later

## This/That

In English, we use the pronoun/definite article "this" when we are talking about something near to us, in either space or time, and "that" when it is further away. Hungarian uses `ez` and `az` similarly. Take note that the one used in each specific situation can vary slightly from English; familiarity will come with practice.

`ez` - this  
`az` - that

Just like English, these can be used in different ways. Firstly, its use as a definite article, to specify proximity of a noun to the speaker: 

* ez a kutyá - (this dog)
* ez az alma - (this apple)
* az a fá - (that tree)
* az az óra - (that clock)

There are two things to be noted from these examples.
1. Unlike in Engish, the definite article `a/az` must also be used.
2. In the section above, we explained how when the next word starts with a vowel sound, the definite article `a` becomes `az`. Therefore, `az` can have two meanings, and a phrase such as `az az óra` (that clock) is possible. The first `az` means "that" and the second means "the."

Secondly, it is used as a pronoun and can be used in place of a noun:

* ez kutyá - (this is a dog)
* az víz - (that is water)
* ez egy macska - (this is a cat)
* látom azt - (I see that) *note the [accusative case](https://magyartanulas.github.io/accusative_plurals/) used here*

`ez` and `az` can be used to ask a question about the identity of an object.

* Mi ez? Ez egy asztal. - (What's this? It is a table.)

In this usage, `egy` is optional and is used to emphasise that fact that there is one. (and not a different number?) (is this right?) Note that in English, where there would be "is," in Hungarian there is nothing.


### Modification of `ez/az` with Suffixes/Plural

Hungarian solves everything with suffixes, and `ez/az` is no exception. 

>The noun suffixes of Hungarian are explained further here: [Plural & Accusative](https://magyartanulas.github.io/accusative_plurals/), [Dative](https://magyartanulas.github.io/dative_possession/), [Locative](https://magyartanulas.github.io/locatives/), [Noun Case Summary](https://magyartanulas.github.io/noun_case_summary/)

There is a rule here: **whenever a suffix is attached to a noun, it is also attached to `ez` and `az` when they are describing the noun.** Vowel harmony (link) must be obeyed, as well as (consonant assimilation thing)

Here are some common suffixes and how they affect `ez` and `az`.

| Suffix   | Meaning        | ez     |  az    | Example              |
|----------|----------------|--------|--------|----------------------|
| -k       | [plural](https://magyartanulas.github.io/accusative_plurals/)                    | ezek   | azok   | Ezek a kutyák zöldek - (These dogs are green)|
| -t       | [accusative](https://magyartanulas.github.io/accusative_plurals/) (direct object)| ezt    | azt    | Látod azt? - (Do you see that?)
| -nak/-nek| [dative](https://magyartanulas.github.io/dative_possession/) (indirect object)   | ennek  | annak  |                      |

They can be combined too:

* Látom azokat a macskákat. - (I see those cats.)

(this is a little advanced for the progression but i think its good to have in this section because its where people would expect to find it)


## Creating Adverbs
---

Here are two common adverb-making suffixes.

### Essive-Modal (-l/ul/-ül)

Front-voweled words take `-ül`, back-voweled words take `-ul` and words ending in vowels take `-l`

***Essively***, meaning that a noun is given a role to fulfill, *as something*. This is done to nouns.

* Például - (As an example) From `példa`
* Ajándékul - (As a gift) From `ajándék`

***Modally***, describes the manner of the person/people doing the verb. This is done to adjectives.

* Jól - (Well) From `jó`
* Rosszul - (Badly) From `rossz`
* Makacsul - (Stubbornly) From `makacs`
* Remekül - (Superbly) From `remek`
* Egyedül - (Alone)

It is also used to show the language someone speaks.

* Magyarul - (lit. Hungarianly) From `magyar`
* Angolul - (lit. Englishly) From `angol`
* Németül - (lit. Germanly) From `német`
* Finnül - (lit. Finnishly) From `finn`

### Adverbial (-n/-an/-en/-on)

Front-voweled words take `-en`, back-voweled words take `-an,-on` and words ending in vowels take `-n`. This is done to adjectives.

* Gyorsan - (Quickly) From `gyors`
* Gyakran - (Frequently) From `gyakor`
* Csendesen - (Silently) From `csend`
* Szépen - (Beautifully/Nicely) From `szép`
* Nagyon - (Very) From `nagy`
* Gazdagon - (Richly) From `gazdag`
* Ritkán - (Rarely) From `ritka`

Look out for irregularites!

* Lassan - (Slowly) From `lassú`

## Creating Nouns
---

There are two ways of creating nouns, the former deals with adjectives/nouns/verbs becoming nouns and the latter with only verbs becoming nouns.

### "-ness"(-ság/-ség)

Front-voweled words take `-ség`, back-voweled words take `-ság`. Crudely speaking, this can be thought of as a "-ness" ending, but it also turns nouns and verbs into nouns.

* Sötétség - (Darkness) From `sötét`
* Segítség - (Help) From `segít`
* Rendőrség - (Police) From `rendőr`
* Igazság - (Truth) From `igaz`
* Szabadság - (Freedom) From `szabad`
* Barátság - (Friendship) From `barát`

### Verb to Noun (-ás/-és)

Front-voweled words take `-ás`, back-voweled words take `-és`.

* Utazás - (Journey) From `utaz`
