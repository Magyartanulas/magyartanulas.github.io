## Consonant Assimilation

In Hungarian, there are certain consonants that, when used as part of an attachment to another word, will change, or assimilate, to the adjacent consonant. This is simply to make the language more natural-sounding and easier to say.

The consonants that can undergo assimilation are `v`, `z` and `j`. (?) (talk about verbs??? I don't know the rules on which scenarios this occurs in etc. I dont think i covered it well)

There are two noun (adjective as well??) cases in Hungarian that begin with "v", `-vá, -vé` (translative) and `-val, -vel` (instrumental). These are attached to the end of a noun.

>For more information on these noun cases and their uses, refer to [noun case summary](https://magyartanulas.github.io/noun_case_summary/).

When one of these suffixes is added to a word, **if the word ends in a consonant, the "v" will change and become that consonant**.

| root + suffix|combined              | meaning   |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------|
| tej + vel    | ~~tejvel~~  tej**j**el | with milk |
| barátom + val|~~barátomval~~  barátom**m**al| with my friend |[possessive suffix](https://magyartanulas.github.io/dative_possession/) used here
| boldog + vá  |~~boldogvá~~  boldog**g**á| become happy|
| gyerek + vé  | ~~gyerekvé~~ gyerek**k**é| become child|

Another scenario in which **consonant assimilation** occurs in Hungarian is with the articles/pronouns `ez` and `az`. Because these end with "z", the "z" will assimilate to the adjacent consonant in a suffix. **With an exception: if the suffix starts with "v," the "z" will dominate.**

| ez + ben  | ~~ezben~~ e**b**ben | in this   |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| az + tól  | ~~aztól~~ a**t**tól | from that |
| ez + vel  | ~~ezvel~~ ez**z**el | with this |

>For more information on `ez` and `az`, refer to [articles](https://magyartanulas.github.io/articles/)

>For more information on the locative cases in this example, see [locatives](https://magyartanulas.github.io/locatives/)


You may be wondering: "what happens if two of these assimilatable consonants are next to each other?" Idk what happensz

Yet to learn:


## This/That

In English, we use the pronoun/definite article "this" when we are talking about something near to us, in either space or time, and "that" when it is further away. Hungarian uses `ez` and `az` similarly. Take note that the one used in each specific situation can vary slightly from English; familiarity will come with practice.

`ez` - this  
`az` - that

Just like English, these can be used in different ways. Firstly, its use as a definite article, to specify proximity of a noun to the speaker: 

* ez a kutyá - (this dog)
* ez az alma - (this apple)
* az a fá - (that tree)
* az az óra - (that clock)

There are two things to be noted from these examples.
1. Unlike in Engish, the definite article `a/az` must also be used.
2. In the section above, we explained how when the next word starts with a vowel sound, the definite article `a` becomes `az`. Therefore, `az` can have two meanings, and a phrase such as `az az óra` (that clock) is possible. The first `az` means "that" and the second means "the."

Secondly, it is used as a pronoun and can be used in place of a noun:

* ez kutyá - (this is a dog)
* az víz - (that is water)
* ez egy macska - (this is a cat)
* látom azt - (I see that) *note the [accusative case](https://magyartanulas.github.io/accusative_plurals/) used here*

`ez` and `az` can be used to ask a question about the identity of an object.

* Mi ez? Ez egy asztal. - (What's this? It is a table.)

In this usage, `egy` is optional and is used to emphasise that fact that there is one. (and not a different number?) (is this right?) Note that in English, where there would be "is," in Hungarian there is nothing.


### Modification of `ez/az` with Suffixes/Plural

Hungarian solves everything with suffixes, and `ez/az` is no exception. 

>The noun suffixes of Hungarian are explained further here: [Plural & Accusative](https://magyartanulas.github.io/accusative_plurals/), [Dative](https://magyartanulas.github.io/dative_possession/), [Locative](https://magyartanulas.github.io/locatives/), [Noun Case Summary](https://magyartanulas.github.io/noun_case_summary/)

There is a rule here: **whenever a suffix is attached to a noun, it is also attached to `ez` and `az` when they are describing the noun.** Vowel harmony (link) must be obeyed, as well as (consonant assimilation thing)

Here are a few common suffixes and how they affect `ez` and `az`.

| Suffix   | Meaning        | ez     |  az    | Example              |
|----------|----------------|--------|--------|----------------------|
| -k       | [plural](https://magyartanulas.github.io/accusative_plurals/)                    | ezek   | azok   | Ezek a kutyák zöldek - (These dogs are green)|
| -t       | [accusative](https://magyartanulas.github.io/accusative_plurals/) (direct object)| ezt    | azt    | Látod azt? - (Do you see that?)
| -nak,-nek| [dative](https://magyartanulas.github.io/dative_possession/) (indirect object)   | ennek  | annak  |                      |
| -val,-vel| [instrumental](https://magyartanulas.github.io/noun_case_summary/) (with)        | ez**z**el| az**z**al|
|-ban,-ben | [inessive](https://magyartanulas.github.io/locatives/) (in)                      | e**b**ben| a**b**ban|

>Note the [consonant assimilation](insert link here) occuring with the last two. With `-val,-vel` the `v` assimilates and becomes `z`, and with `-ban,-ben`, the `z` becomes `b`.

The suffixes can be combined, too:

* Látom azokat a macskákat. - (I see those cats.)

(this is a little advanced for the progression but i think its good to have in this section because its where people would expect to find it)


## Creating Adverbs
---

Here are two common adverb-making suffixes.

### Essive-Modal (-l/ul/-ül)

Front-voweled words take `-ül`, back-voweled words take `-ul` and words ending in vowels take `-l`

***Essively***, meaning that a noun is given a role to fulfill, *as something*. This is done to nouns.

* Például - (As an example) From `példa`
* Ajándékul - (As a gift) From `ajándék`

***Modally***, describes the manner of the person/people doing the verb. This is done to adjectives.

* Jól - (Well) From `jó`
* Rosszul - (Badly) From `rossz`
* Makacsul - (Stubbornly) From `makacs`
* Remekül - (Superbly) From `remek`
* Egyedül - (Alone)

It is also used to show the language someone speaks.

* Magyarul - (lit. Hungarianly) From `magyar`
* Angolul - (lit. Englishly) From `angol`
* Németül - (lit. Germanly) From `német`
* Finnül - (lit. Finnishly) From `finn`

### Adverbial (-n/-an/-en/-on)

Front-voweled words take `-en`, back-voweled words take `-an,-on` and words ending in vowels take `-n`. This is done to adjectives.

* Gyorsan - (Quickly) From `gyors`
* Gyakran - (Frequently) From `gyakor`
* Csendesen - (Silently) From `csend`
* Szépen - (Beautifully/Nicely) From `szép`
* Nagyon - (Very) From `nagy`
* Gazdagon - (Richly) From `gazdag`
* Ritkán - (Rarely) From `ritka`

Look out for irregularites!

* Lassan - (Slowly) From `lassú`

## Creating Nouns
---

There are two ways of creating nouns, the former deals with adjectives/nouns/verbs becoming nouns and the latter with only verbs becoming nouns.

### "-ness"(-ság/-ség)

Front-voweled words take `-ség`, back-voweled words take `-ság`. Crudely speaking, this can be thought of as a "-ness" ending, but it also turns nouns and verbs into nouns.

* Sötétség - (Darkness) From `sötét`
* Segítség - (Help) From `segít`
* Rendőrség - (Police) From `rendőr`
* Igazság - (Truth) From `igaz`
* Szabadság - (Freedom) From `szabad`
* Barátság - (Friendship) From `barát`

### Verb to Noun (-ás/-és)

Front-voweled words take `-ás`, back-voweled words take `-és`.

* Utazás - (Journey) From `utaz`
