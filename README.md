### Welcome!

This repository is the most complete **and errorless** guide to the Hungarian Language.

For all intents and purposes, this repository shall serve as a supplement to Hungarian study. Even though
this will be made as fun and readable as possible, it shouldn't replace your learning. In light of this, there will be
websites listed below for further resources.

The goal here is clarification, seeing as most native english speakers aren't given a thorough grammer education, these concepts
shall be explained where relevant.
