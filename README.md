## Welcome!

This repository is the most complete **and errorless** guide to the Hungarian Language.

For all intents and purposes, this repository shall serve as a supplement to Hungarian grammar study. Even though
this will be made as fun and readable as possible, it shouldn't replace your learning. In light of this, there will be
websites listed below for further resources for practicing vocabulary and other aspects with the language.

The goal here is clarification. Seeing as most native english speakers aren't given a thorough grammer education, these concepts
shall be explained where relevant. The grammar will be explained in a progression route with sections from beginner to advanced.

### Progression Route

1. [The Alphabet & Vowel Harmony](/Section1.md)
2. The Copular Verb (van) & Introductions
3. Nouns, Postpositions & Articles
4. The Accusative Case (-t) & Plurals (-k)
5. Definite & Indefinite Conjugation
6. Negation
7. The Dative Case (-nak/-nek) & Possession
8. Tetszik & Vonz
9. The Conjugated Infinitive & Expressing need
10. Making Comparisons (-bb, leg-, ilyen/olyan, így/úgy, mint)
11. Locative cases & Triadic Pronouns
