title: Common Adverbs

layout: page
---

There are two common suffixes involved with creating adverbs. There isn't too much of a difference between them, so these kinds of adverbs neeed to be memorised.

## `-l/-ul/-ül`
---

Among other things, `-ul,-ül` is used to turn adjectives into adverbs. Naturally front-voweled adjectives take the `-ül` ending, back-voweled `-ul` and those ending in vowels get `-l`.

* Jól - (Well) From jó
* Rosszul - (Badly) From rossz
* Makacsul - (Stubbornly) From makacs
* Remekül - (Superbly) From remek
* Egyedül - (Alone)

It is also used to show the language someone speaks.

* Magyarul - (lit. Hungarianly) From magyar
* Angolul - (lit. Englishly) From angol
* Németül - (lit. Germanly) From német
* Finnül - (lit. Finnishly) From finn

## `-n/-an/-en/-on`

Front-voweled words take `-en`, back-voweled words take -an,-on and words ending in vowels take -n. This is done to adjectives.

    Gyorsan - (Quickly) From gyors
    Gyakran - (Frequently) From gyakor 
    Csendesen - (Silently) From csend
    Szépen - (Beautifully/Nicely) From szép
    Nagyon - (Very) From nagy
    Gazdagon - (Richly) From gazdag
    Ritkán - (Rarely) From ritka

However `gyakor` is hardly used in practice.

There are some adjectives that can become adverbs from either ending. E.g. `piszkos`

* Figyeltem a kresz tablákra piszkosul. - ([Lyric:](http://www.zeneszoveg.hu/dalszoveg/105413/pamkutya/luis-fonsi---despacito-parodia-zeneszoveg.html) I paid attention to the traffic signs like crazy!)
* Figyeltem a kresz tablákra piszkosan. - (I paid attention to the traffic signs dirtily (physically))
