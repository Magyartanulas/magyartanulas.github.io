title: The Infinitive Verb Form
---


The infinitive conveys a verb that has no tense or relation to a noun.

In English, if you look up a verb in the dictionary, it will give you the verb in the infinitive. These verbs can be either preceded 
by `to`, succeeded by `ing` or not at all.

* I need *to go*.
* I like *playing* games.
* I must *leave*.

In Hungarian, the base-verb (taken from the 3rd person singular indefinite) is only succeeded by `-ni`. It also does not have any definite or indefinite conjugation.

* Szeretek *olvasni* - (I like to read/reading)
* Holnap tudok *menni* - (I can go tomorrow)
* Mikor foglak *látni*? - (When will I see you?)

When using the infinitive, be aware that it won't always line up with the base-verb. There are two cases:

**Case 1: Vowel Harmony**

Depending on how the verb ends will determine if it has a linking vowel or not. The two forms of vowel harmony are `-ani, -eni`.

If the verb ends in `-ít` it will receive a linking vowel.

* segít - *segíteni* (to help)
* kiegészít - *kiegészíteni* (to complete)
* borít - *borítani* (to cover)
* lefordít - *fordítani* (to translate)

Or if the verb ends in two consonants it will also receive a linking vowel.

* dönt - *dönteni* (to decide)
* éleszt - *éleszteni* (to revive)
* játsz - *játszani* (to play)
* mond - *mondani* (to say)

**Case 2: Irregular verb**

The verb that you are using could in fact be an irregular verb, in which case it will have different conjugations and possibly a different infinitive). 
Here is a list of all the irregular verbs, bolds and italics are there to help indicate pattern.

| téved (he/she/it errs)                   | tévedni       |

**Addendum**

It is worth noting that to cheer in Hungarian, you wouldn't say *you can do it!* but rather `menni fog` or `sikerülni fog`. 
They literally mean *it will go* and *it will succeed* respectively.
