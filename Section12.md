## The Comparative and Superlative

In English, if you want to show that something is different to something else in some way, you use comparatives.

* It is slower.
* This is more comfortable to wear.
* My brother is taller than me.

And if you want to say that something is the best, no questions asked, then you use the superlative.

* We're here because you're looking for the best of the best of the best, sir!
* He is the fastest man in the world.
* That is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!

Naturally, Hungarian solves this issue with attachments.

To use the comparative, attach `-bb` to the end of a noun, and to make that comparative into a superlative attach `leg-` to the start of that noun. To go *even further beyond* we can attach `leges-` to exaggerate the superlative.

* Te vagy a legnagyobb hős a világon! - (You are the biggest hero in the world!)
* A szomszéd fűje mindig zöldebb. - (This is an expression: The neighbour's grass is always greener.)
* Ő a legeslegszebb lány számomra. - (She's the most beautiful girl for me.)

*Note: számára is a postposition, in this case számomra is more intentional than nekem.*
