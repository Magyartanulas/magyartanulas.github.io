## This/That

In English, we use the demonstrative pronoun "this" when we are talking about something near to us, in either space or time, and "that" when it is further away. Hungarian uses `ez` and `az` similarly. Take note that the one used in each specific situation can vary slightly from English; familiarity will come with practice.

`Ez` - This  
`Az` - That

Just like English, these can be used in different ways. Firstly, its use in conjunction with a definite article, to specify proximity of a noun to the speaker: 

* Ez a kutyá. - (This dog.)
* Az az alma. - (This apple.)
* Az a fá. - (That tree.)
* Az az óra. - (That clock.)

**Note:**

* Unlike in English, the definite article `a/az` must also be used.
* If the noun begins with a vowel, `a` changes to `az`.

Secondly, it is used to introduce new information.

* ez kutyá - (this is a dog)
* az víz - (that is water)
* ez egy macska - (this is a cat)
* látom azt - (I see that)

`Ez` and `az` can be used to ask a question about the identity of an object.

* Mi ez? Ez egy asztal. - (What's this? This is a table.)

In this usage, `egy` is only used to specify that there is just one. Note that in English, where there would be "is," in Hungarian there is nothing.

## Articles

An article specifies if a noun is a definite thing or an indefinite thing.

In English this is demonstrated by *a/an* or *the*. Article *a* is used when the following noun begins with a consonant (a flower),
and *an* is used when that noun begins with a vowel (an icecream).

* **The** flower - *there is **definitely** one specific flower being talked about.*
* **A** flower - *we are talking about any one of many flowers out there, it is **not definite**.*

In Hungarian the articles are `egy, a/az`. Article `egy` is indefinite (it is also the number one as well), whereas `a/az` is definite.
Similar to English, `a` is used when the noun begins with a consonant and `az` with a noun beginning with a vowel.

* A kutya - *The dog*
* Az autó - *The car*
* Egy virág - *A flower*

### Usage

Just like in English, the indefinite article is used to specify just one thing and to introduce a new noun to the conversation. As soon as this noun becomes known to the conversation, the definite article is used. 

* Ez az ember itt dolgozik. - (This person works here.)
* Ez egy öreg fa. - (This is an old tree.)
* Az a fiú mindig panaszkodik. - (That boy is always complaining.)
* Az egy híres épület. - (That's a famous building.) 

The definite article is also used before abstract nouns.

* Az élet. - (Life.)
* A zene. - (Music.)
* A szabadság. - (Freedom.)

Proper nouns don't use an article, except for specifying a type of pronoun. Similarly, this is used when talking about nouns that are members of a group. 

* A Középkori Európa. - (Medieval Europe.)
* A Korszerű/Mai Magyarország. - (Modern-day Hungary.)
* A tarajos sül rágcsáló. - (Porcupines are rodent.)
* A darázs rovar. - (Wasps are insects.)
* A nárcisz virág. - (Daffodils are flowers.)
* A jacht csónak. - (Yachts are boats.)

You can also make generalisations about nouns with the definite article.

* A farkasok ülvöltenek. - (Wolves howl.)
* A madarak csiripelnek. - (Birds chirp.)
* A magyarok pálinkát isznak. - (Hungarians drink Pálinka.)

If you listen on public transport, the definite article is used when announcing the next stop (as a street/square) or you can hear it used for institutions and organisations.

* A következő megálló a Hősök Tere. - ( The next stop is Hero's Square.)
* Sok ember van, a Váci Utcában. - (There are many people on Váci Street.)
* A Balassi Intézet kiváló hely a magyar nyelvtanuláshoz. - (The Balassi institute is an excellent place for hungarian language learning.)

The article is often omitted in certain situations in Hungarian. Aside from the examples mentioned before, all the times that English uses an indefinite article, Hungarian uses none. It is also omitted for dates.

* Ma Március 23 van. - (Today is March the 23rd.)
* Nyelvtanár vagyok. - (I am a language teacher.)
* Tűz van! - (There's a fire!)
* Kicsit jobb lesz holnap. - (It will be a little better tomorrow.)
* Szép munkát végzel! - (You're doing a nice job!)
* Kérsz kólát? - (Would you like some coke? lit. You ask for coke?)

These examples show that the quantity is not important.
