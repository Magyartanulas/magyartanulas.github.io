title: Introduction to Word Building
---

As you may have noticed already, Hungarian is an agglutinative language, it uses suffixes and prefixes to solve most of its problems. Part of this involves adding suffixes to words to create more words.

## Creating Adverbs
---

### Essive-Modal (-l/ul/-ül)

Front-voweled words take `-ül`, back-voweled words take `-ul` and words ending in vowels get `-l`

***Essively***, meaning that a noun is given a role to fulfill, *as something*. This is done to nouns.

* Például - (As an example)
* Ajándékul - (As a gift)

***Modally***, describes the manner of the person/people doing the verb. This is done to adjectives.

* Jól - (Well) From `jó`
* Rosszul - (Badly) From `rossz`
* Makacsul - (Stubbornly) From `makacs`
* Remekül - (Superbly) From `remek`
* Egyedül - (Alone)

It is also used to show the language someone speaks.

* Magyarul - (lit. Hungarianly) From `magyar`
* Angolul - (lit. Englishly) From `angol`
* Németül - (lit. Germanly) From `német`
* Finnül - (lit. Finnishly) From `finn`

### Adverbial (-n/-an/-en)

Front-voweled words take `-en`, back-voweled words take `-an` and words ending in vowels take `-n`.
